Kimai is time tracking system, contains many pages, we will go in deepth in studing them.

Dashboard (As Admin):

    -featuers:

        - weekly report for working time.
        - total worinkg hour:
            - from the beginning of the year till the day date.
            - weekly.
            - in the current date.
        - leaves:
            - the same with working hour.
            - palnning leaves.
    
    - what we can add:
        - hourly leaves and the remaning time.
        - remaning leaves for each new planning leave/ sick leaves /other types of leave.


    - Time tracking:
        - my time
        - my weekly time.
        - calender to log yhe work hours.
        - page that contains all time log for all employees.
    
    - What we can do here:
        - in the time tracking record there is no filed to the type of the activity (which an admin can add them)
        - there is mo limitation for the work range (at time or at work hours also the admin can detect that maybe there are bank hours or remotly work type or others)
        - any assinge ticket in any version control should be automatically added (also the review one, the commits, and the comments)
        - deny adding any entry in leave day.
        - check the status of ticket (when it's closed or resolved).
        - there is no  auto - increasing in date and hours.
        - if there is two time tracking sys or more  (maybe for the companies we work for) there should be no joint time.

    - Weekly hour:
        - here we can see all of the employees work hours.
    
    - What we can do here:
        - maybe enhancing the visualization of the page.

    - Calender :
        - the same limitations in the my times page.
    
    - Export:
        - we can add excel /pdf/ csv , also we can make multiple type of pdf to work with.

    - Reports:
        - one of the powerful features of KIMAI is reportting.
        - No cahnges maybe add some visualization.

    - Tasks:
        - I think we can add this page within the report or statistics page.

    - Adminstration:
        - Add cutomers, projects, users, tags, tickets, so on.
    - What we can do:
        - just add the values with the prevouis enhancing steps (number of leave days, ticket type, ...)

    - System:
        - just give the permession for user, group or roles.
        - create a new team (I think this maybe can be edited to be in another page)
        - Settings (maybe 50% of this page can be included into roles tab)
        - importer is important (in case of backup or any damage in the data we can restore the data within few hours)
        - Custom fileds: to disccus it
